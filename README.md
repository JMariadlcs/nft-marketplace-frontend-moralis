# NFT MARKETPLACE FRONTEND MORALIS 🦄

This is a one of the two Frontend implementation of a NFT Marketplace from Patrick Alpha's fcc. The backend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/nft-marketplace-backend).

The frontend of this project is being implemented in two different ways:

1. Using [Moralis Indexer Frontend](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/nft-marketplace-frontend-moralis).
2. Using TheGraph.
